Build a browser-based design editor (a simplified version of Canva/Figma, focused on business card design) using Next.js and Tailwind CSS (no TypeScript). The editor should allow users to add, move, resize, rotate, align, and export elements inside a fixed-size canvas.

Requirements
1. Canvas & Elements

A fixed-size card canvas (e.g., 600×350px, locked aspect ratio).

Users can add the following element types:

Text blocks: editable text with controls for font, size, bold/italic/underline, and color.

Shapes: rectangle, circle, and line.

Images: uploaded from local device, auto-fit, draggable.

SVG icons: selectable from a predefined set.

Each element must support:

Dragging (free positioning).

Resizing (with handles).

Rotating (with a rotation handle).

Deletion (via Delete key or button).

2. Element Management

Layer panel (sidebar):

Displays all elements in a stack.

Drag-and-drop to reorder layers (bring forward/backward).

Clicking an element in the sidebar selects it on the canvas.

Properties panel:

Dynamic controls depending on element type.

Text → font, size, color.

Image → replace, crop, opacity.

Live updates reflected on canvas.

3. Alignment & Snapping

Alignment guidelines when moving elements (center lines, equal spacing).

Snapping to canvas edges and center points.

Keyboard controls:

Arrow keys = move by 1px.

Shift + arrow keys = move by 10px.

4. Multi-Select & Grouping

Multi-element selection (Ctrl + click).

Group/ungroup elements.

Groups can be moved, resized, and rotated together.

5. Undo / Redo

Full undo/redo history (at least 20 steps) with:

Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y (Windows).

Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z (Mac).

6. Export

Export final design as high-resolution PNG/JPEG/PDF.

Ensure sharp text/SVG output.

All handles, guidelines, and outlines must be excluded from exports.

7. UI/UX

Clean, professional UI (inspired by Figma).

Sidebar panels for layers and properties.

Minimal but modern look (Tailwind-based).

Smooth animations for select/deselect actions.

Dark/Light mode toggle.

8. Performance

Handle 50+ elements on canvas without noticeable lag.

Optimize rendering with React.memo and efficient selectors.

Virtualize the layer list if needed.

Stretch Goals (Optional)

Smart text fitting (auto-resizes text inside its box).

Grid snapping with customizable grid size.

Starter templates (at least 3 layouts to choose from).

PWA support: installable, offline-ready, saves state to localStorage.

Export/import design as JSON for collaboration.

Deliverables

A working Next.js app styled with Tailwind CSS (no TypeScript).

State management via Redux Toolkit.

Uses mock data only (no backend required).
